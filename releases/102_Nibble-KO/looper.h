// looper.h — the four-bar event loop behind DRUMS mode.
//
// This records EVENTS, not audio. That decision buys three things that matter:
//
//   1. OVERDUB IS LOSSLESS. Nothing is re-recorded, so a twentieth pass sounds
//      exactly like the first. An audio looper degrades a little every pass.
//   2. TEMPO IS A PLAYBACK PARAMETER. A position is stored in loop TICKS, not
//      in samples, so turning the tempo knob re-times the pattern instead of
//      pitching it.
//   3. IT FITS. Four bytes per event, 512 events, 2KB total. One second of
//      48kHz audio would be 96KB.
//
// Quantisation of DRUM HITS is applied at CAPTURE — see QuantGrid's comment
// for why this reverses the card's original design (a live playback filter
// cannot let two different grids, e.g. a straight part and a triplet fill,
// coexist in one loop; snapping once at RecordHit() time can). Filter/tone
// AUTOMATION is the one thing still true to the original design: never
// snapped at all, at capture or playback, because a quantised knob sweep is
// a staircase rather than a curve.

	/// reads its depth from it. Unlike the effect lanes this only writes while
	/// the knob is actually MOVING, exactly like the filter and tone lanes —
	/// a still knob must not flatten a curve recorded on an earlier pass.
