// main.cpp — NIBBLE-KO. Card entry point, mode machine, UI, output routing.
//
// A program card for the Music Thing Modular Workshop System Computer, built
// on Chris Johnson's header-only ComputerCard library.
//
// NIBBLE-KO reads ONE output of the Workshop System's FOUR VOLTAGES module on
// CV In 1, learns which voltage each button combination produces, and turns
// the combinations into drum hits. See levels.h for the ghost rule, which is
// the piece of this card that cannot be guessed from the code around it.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE CONTROL SURFACE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The switch is a MODE SELECTOR, not a trigger. Its three positions:
//
//   DOWN    choose a mode. The four buttons pick one; the choice is committed
//           when the switch is RELEASED, and then LATCHES.
//   MIDDLE  play the latched mode.
//   UP      play the latched mode AND record it into the loop.
//
// Latching is what makes every mode recordable through one mechanism: mode
// selection is a transient Down-gesture that has finished by the time you
// reach Up, so Down and Up never need to be held at once.
//
//   switch+A  DRUMS    the kit (power-on default)
//   switch+B  MUTE     three mute-group toggles
//   switch+C  FX       twelve performance effects
//   switch+D  PATTERN  four stored loops: tap recalls, hold stores
//
// Inside a mode, THE MODE'S OWN BUTTON IS THE SHIFT — the same hold-and-tap
// mechanic the kit is played with, so the whole card is one gesture:
//
//   MUTE     hold B, tap A / C / D    toggle mute group 1 / 2 / 3
//   PATTERN  hold D, tap A / B / C    recall that slot, instantly
//            ...with the switch UP    store the live loop into it instead
//
// The SWITCH is the verb in PATTERN mode. Up already means "commit this to
// the loop" everywhere else on the card, and storing a pattern is the same
// idea one level up — so it costs no new gesture to learn.
//
// A hold-to-store gesture would not work here, and the reason is the quirk
// this whole card is built around: Four Voltages LATCHES. A held button is a
// level that sits there indefinitely, so any "held for N ticks" test passes
// eventually and every recall becomes a store.
//
// A recall does NOT move the playhead: the new loop picks up wherever in the
// bar you already are, so switching mid-bar reads as the band changing part
// rather than a stop and start. Recall DISCARDS whatever you were playing,
// which is what makes it possible to try something over a pattern and
// abandon it.
//
// FX1 goes further: ANY single is a shift there, so it carries TWELVE
// effects rather than three — four shifts by three taps, exactly as the kit
// gets twelve voices from the same four buttons. One family per shift, so
// the layout is learnable as four groups rather than twelve pairings:
//
//   hold A + B/C/D   filters      low-pass / high-pass / band sweep
//   hold B + A/C/D   destruction  bit-crush / decimate / wavefold
//   hold C + A/B/D   rhythmic     stutter / flam / gate
//   hold D + A/B/C   transport    reverse / tape-stop / silence
//
// The D bank means DIFFERENT THINGS to a sampled voice and a synthesised
// one, which is why those three are grouped: the gesture is "play it wrong
// on purpose", and what that means depends on what the voice is made of.
// Reverse plays a recording backwards, and runs a synth voice's ENVELOPE
// backwards — a swell instead of a decay. Tape-stop winds a recording's rate
// down to nothing, and a synth voice's PITCH down to nothing. Both are armed
// at trigger time, so they catch hits that start while the effect is held
// and leave ones already sounding alone.
//
// HOLD A SHIFT ALONE and turn Main to draw that lane's PARAMETER CURVE. It
// needs no gesture of its own because it is the absence of one — you are
// already holding the shift, so letting go of the tap hands the knob to the
// curve. Each shift therefore owns two recorded lanes, an effect and a
// parameter, performed independently: sweep a curve once, then pop the three
// effects in and out over the top of it across later passes.
//
// The curve is the single source of depth. An effect reads it whether it is
// live or replayed, so what you hear performing is exactly what records.
//
// Main sets each effect's depth. See fx.h for the table and fx.cpp for the
// DSP. FX2 is deliberately left at three as a placeholder — if one bank
// holds twelve, whether a second bank should exist at all is a real
// question, and worth answering after playing these rather than before.
//
// While FX1 is the mode, Main is the effect DEPTH and NOT the DJ filter —
// one knob cannot do both, and sweeping a crush depth would sweep the filter
// with it. The filter latches where it was, and picks up again only when the
// knob is turned back THROUGH that value, so leaving the mode never jumps
// it. Same convention as a DJ mixer recalling a patch. See SoftPickup.
//
// A bare press does nothing in these modes. That is not a restriction, it is
// the only thing that WORKS: to press A twice you must pass back through the
// rest voltage, so a bare-press toggle can mute a group and never unmute it.
// Holding the shift makes each tap a pair, and the ghost rule silences the
// release back onto the shift — so tap-tap-tap toggles as often as you like.
//
//   switch+AB  UNDO          switch+AC  QUANTISE (cycle the record grid)
//   switch+CD  PLAY/STOP     switch+BD  enter the USB/browser setup
//
// The adjacent pairs carry what you reach for mid-take; the WebUI takes the
// awkward diagonal because it is a setup activity done with both hands free.
//
// WHY SINGLES COMMIT ON RELEASE BUT PAIRS FIRE IMMEDIATELY. This asymmetry
// looks like an inconsistency and is not — both halves fall out of the ghost
// rule, pointing in opposite directions:
//
//   Four Voltages does not return to a rest voltage when you let go, so the
//   CV sits whereever it was last put. If it is ALREADY on A's level and you
//   press A to select DRUMS, the level never changes and no Trigger is ever
//   produced — a press-driven select would simply never fire, and the card
//   would look broken. Reading the STATE on release works regardless.
//
//   A pair cannot get stuck that way. Releasing a pair falls back onto one of
//   its own members, and levels.cpp sets current_ to that SINGLE (the
//   GhostArmed branch). So the resting state is always a single, a pair press
//   is always a genuine transition, and acting on the Trigger is safe.

// PANEL
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//   CV In 1      Four Voltages output          (the instrument itself)
//   Pulse In 1   external clock, one edge per beat
//
//   Main   DJ filter (LP | bypass | HP)   /  FX depth in an effects mode
//   X      tempo, 40-240bpm (unless clocked)
//   Y      kit character
//
//   Audio Out 1  drum bus                 Audio Out 2  the same drum bus
//   Pulse Out 1  gate on every hit        Pulse Out 2  click, one per beat
//   CV Out 1/2   unassigned for now
//
// Calibration is the ALT-BOOT mode — hold the switch down at power-on — with
// the learned levels saved to flash (calibstore.h) and reloaded on every
// normal boot, so a normal power-up is playable within the splash. See the
// splash handler in ProcessSample().
//
// DURING a calibration the switch has a different job, as it does in NIBBLE:
//
//   tap        capture the voltage of the combo you are holding
//   hold 2s    throw this calibration away — reverts to the last SAVED
//              calibration if one exists, otherwise starts the learn again
//
// Capture is a TAP rather than the button press itself because the press and
// the voltage arriving are the same event — the settle detector cannot have
// trusted the reading yet. Holding the combo and tapping separates the two.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// TWO CORES, AND WHY
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Core 0 plays the card: the drum voices, one SVF, the CV stage — a few
// hundred cycles against a budget of 4000 at 192MHz. That never needed a
// second core and still does not.
//
// USB does. TinyUSB's tud_task() measured ~36000 cycles on WorkshopBio, i.e.
// 14x the entire 20.8us audio budget, so it cannot share the audio interrupt.
// It lives on core 1 (see core1Entry at the bottom of this file), and it is
// MODAL: core 1 spins doing nothing until switch+B+D sets WebUI::usbMode, so
// on a card that is being played the stack is never even initialised.
//
// When an upload starts, core 0 parks inside ProcessSample() and core 1 owns
// the machine — including the LEDs. See ShowUploadProgress().

	// Two things to settle first, neither technical: whether twelve effects
	// per bank is more than a player can hold in their head, and whether FX2
