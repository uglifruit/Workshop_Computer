# Glitch — Workshop Computer Program Card

A clock-synced beat-repeater and audio degradation effect. Glitch continuously records incoming audio into a circular buffer, then — when triggered — replays a frozen slice of that buffer at a subdivided rate, with optional reversal and lo-fi degradation.

---

## Inputs

### Audio (top row)
| Jack | Function |
|------|----------|
| Audio In 1 | Main audio input — continuously recorded into the buffer |

### Pulse (bottom row)
| Jack | Function |
|------|----------|
| Pulse In 1 | **Clock input** — rising edge sets the beat length. Each new pulse measures the time since the last pulse (in samples) to define MasterLoopLength. Maximum buffer is 0.5 seconds; longer beats are capped. |
| Pulse In 2 | **External gate** — used only when Switch is in MID position. While HIGH, forces glitching on the current slice. |

### CV (middle row)
| Jack | Function |
|------|----------|
| CV In 1 | **Freeze** — treated as a comparator. When the voltage is above ~0V (ADC value > 2047), the buffer stops recording. The frozen content loops continuously. Below ~0V, recording resumes. |

## Outputs (top row)

| Jack | Function |
|------|----------|
| Audio Out 1 | Glitched output — or live pass-through when not glitching |
| Audio Out 2 | Always dry — live pass-through of Audio In 1 regardless of glitch state |
| Pulse Out 1 | Sub-slice clock — fires a one-sample pulse at every ratchet slice boundary |
| CV Out 1 | Glitch gate — high (~+5V) while glitching, low (0V) while passing through |
| CV Out 2 | Descending ramp — falls from ~+5V to 0V across each slice, resets at boundary. Patch to a VCA to fade out each repeated slice. |
| Pulse Out 2 | Clock mirror — passes Pulse In 1 straight through |

## Controls

### Main Knob — Ratchet Zone + Probability

The Main Knob does two things simultaneously, hidden within a single sweep.

The knob range (0–4095) is divided into **5 equal zones**. The zone you are in selects the **ratchet division** — how many times the captured beat slice is subdivided and repeated:

| Zone | Ratchet | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| 1 (fully CCW) | ÷1 | Whole beat repeated once |
| 2 | ÷2 | Beat cut in half, each half repeated |
| 3 | ÷3 | Beat cut into thirds |
| 4 | ÷4 | Beat cut into quarters |
| 5 (fully CW) | ÷6 | Beat cut into sixths |

**Hidden within each zone:** the position of the knob *within* that zone sets the **Reverse Probability Threshold**. At the bottom of a zone there is no reversal; approaching the top of the zone, random reversal becomes increasingly likely. This probability also controls whether glitching fires at all in Probabilistic mode (Switch UP).

LED 5 (bottom right) shows the current probability threshold as brightness — use it to navigate within zones.

### Knob X — Degradation Amount

Controls the depth of two simultaneous lo-fi effects applied to glitched slices.

**Bitcrushing** — reduces the bit depth of the audio. At minimum (fully CCW) the audio is clean. As the knob increases, low bits are progressively masked off: at mid-range you get 8-bit grit; near maximum, extremely coarse quantisation.

**Decimation (sample-rate reduction)** — quantises the read position so the same sample plays multiple times before advancing. Creates a stepped, aliased texture. At minimum, smooth playback. At maximum, the signal advances in steps of 16 samples, giving a heavily lo-fi character.

Both effects scale together as Knob X increases. At zero, degradation is completely bypassed regardless of Knob Y.

---

### Knob Y — Degradation Probability

Sets **how often** the degradation (bitcrush + decimation) actually applies to a given slice. This is evaluated fresh at every slice boundary.

- Fully CCW (0): degradation never applies, even if Knob X is turned up — the audio is always clean
- Mid-range: degradation fires roughly half the time, alternating between clean and degraded slices
- Fully CW (4095): degradation always applies

Combine Knob X (amount) and Knob Y (probability) to dial in anything from subtle occasional grit to relentless destruction.

---

### Switch — Glitch Trigger Mode

The switch selects how glitching (ratcheting + reversal) is activated. Glitch state is locked in for the full duration of each slice, then re-evaluated at the next slice boundary.

| Position | Mode | Behaviour |
|----------|------|-----------|
| **UP** (latching) | Probabilistic | At each slice boundary, a random number is compared to the Main Knob's hidden remainder threshold. If the random value falls below the threshold, glitching fires. Low threshold = rare glitches. High threshold = frequent glitches. |
| **MID** | External Gate | Glitching is active whenever Pulse In 2 is HIGH. Use an external gate, envelope, or sequencer to control exactly when glitching occurs. |
| **DOWN** (momentary) | Force | Glitching is always on, regardless of probability or gate. Useful for manual performance — hold down to freeze into the glitch, release to return to pass-through. |

When **not glitching**, the module passes live audio from Audio In 1 directly to the outputs. No buffer playback, no degradation.

## LEDs

```
| LED 0   LED 1 |
| LED 2   LED 3 |
| LED 4   LED 5 |
```

| LED | Function |
|-----|----------|
| LED 0 | Lit when Main Knob is in Zone 1 (ratchet ÷1) |
| LED 1 | Lit when Main Knob is in Zone 2 (ratchet ÷2) |
| LED 2 | Lit when Main Knob is in Zone 3 (ratchet ÷3) |
| LED 3 | Lit when Main Knob is in Zone 4 (ratchet ÷4) |
| LED 4 | Lit when Main Knob is in Zone 5 (ratchet ÷6) |
| LED 5 | **Brightness** = reverse probability threshold (the hidden remainder within the current zone). Dim = low probability, bright = high probability. |

Only one of LEDs 0–4 is lit at a time, showing your current ratchet selection at a glance.

## Signal Flow

               Pulse In 2 (Gate) ──► [Switch MID only] force glitch
               CV In 2 (bipolar) ──► offsets Knob X + Knob Y

```

When not glitching, Audio In 1 passes straight to the outputs, bypassing the buffer entirely.

## Getting Started

1. Patch a clock or LFO square wave into **Pulse In 1**
2. Patch audio into **Audio In 1**
3. Listen on **Audio Out 1**
4. Set Switch to **DOWN** — you should immediately hear the beat repeating
5. Turn the **Main Knob** clockwise to hear higher ratchet subdivisions
6. Move Switch to **UP** and explore the probability zone within each ratchet setting
7. Bring up **Knob X** for degradation; use **Knob Y** to control how often it fires
8. Patch a gate into **CV In 1** (above 0V) to freeze the buffer at a particular moment

## Notes

- Before the first clock pulse arrives, the module passes audio through without glitching
- Beat lengths longer than 0.5 seconds are automatically capped at the buffer size
- Very short beats (faster than ~2ms per subdivision) use the minimum slice of 1 sample with no fade
- The buffer records even while glitching — on the next beat, fresh audio is available
- Degradation is evaluated independently of glitch mode — you can have degraded pass-through if Knob Y is high and Switch is DOWN with no gate signal
